1. Game rules:

	A memory card game. 1-6* players are shown 5-52 pairs of poker cards. 
	Players take turns to find matching pairs. If a player finds a pair, it is added to their
	score. After finding a pair, the player can continue until they cannot find a pair.
	When a pair is not found, it is the next player's turn. The game continues until 
	all pairs have been found. The winner(s) is/are the player(s) with the most found pairs. 
	So, the game can even possibly end in a tie.
